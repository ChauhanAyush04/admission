# Admission Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model that predicts student admission chances based on various factors like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, and other related metrics.

## Project Overview

This project uses a **Neural Network** built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to predict the chances of admission to a university. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various features related to student applications. The goal is to predict the **probability of admission** (a continuous value) for a given student based on their scores and background.

## Requirements

Before running this code, make sure to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn pickle
